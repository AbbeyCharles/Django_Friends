Coding Dojo Python black belt exam.  As far as I know, no one else has ever taken this exam in Django (opting instead for the simpler Coding Dojo framework known as Pylot).  I completed it in just under 3.5 hours (4.5 hour limit) and received a perfect score.  I ended up wasting a solid 45 minutes in attempting to create a joining table in order to create the many to many self join relationship before realizing that it could be accomplished within the user's table (no other table necessary).

A short video demonstration of the app's functionality can be seen here:
